## Description

A CMS-style forum application, where developers can create, edit, and delete their own forum posts, along with comment and interact with other developersâ€™ forums posts as well.

## Technologies

- MySQL
- Express
- Sequelize
- Handlebars
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript
- Heroku

## Installation

_Note: This [guide](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mysql/mysql-installation-guide) will walk you through how to download and setup MySQL on your local machine._ Use `mysql -u root p` to input your password and start up your MySQL server.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Create your `.env` file. (Example at `.env.example`).
3. Select & download your package manager: [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).
4. Inside your terminal, run `npm install`, `pnpm install`, or `yarn install` to download all dependencies.

_I used npm for this application, but if you decide to use another package manager, update the package.json accordingly._

## Usage

4. Run `node seeds/seed.js` to seed your database.
5. Run `node server.js` to start up your server.
6. Go for the gold!
